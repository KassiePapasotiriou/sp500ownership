# Exploration of the S&P 500 stock ownership in Robinhood
Jingwen Du, Kassiani Papasotiriou

We are looking to explore any patterns in S&P 500 stock ownership on the financial app Robinhood  between Aug 2018 - Aug 2020.

Robinhood is an investment app focused on retail investors.  In particular retail investors have significantly increased their usage and presence on Robinhood amid the post-COVID market volatility. This spurred heightened focus and attention by news reports and financial institutions to see if there's any insight we can see from these retail involvement in the stock market.
