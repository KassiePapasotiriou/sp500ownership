We will also investigate if we have missing patterns and try to understand the cause behind that. 4.1 Overview of missing values First we read in the raw data. We haven’t performed any tranformations to the dataframe apart from combining from different datasources. In order to start exploring missing values we will look at the ratio of the number of NAs in each column and row: ## Date Symbol Adj.Close Volume users_holding ## 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.003158734 0.003158734 0.062136036 ## vix_Adj_close Mcap ## 0.003112053 0.022546827 We can see immediately that we have a very low percentage in missing values. The columns in our dataframe that have the most missing entries are Volume and users_holding with around 5% and 6% missing values respectively. 4.2 Visualizing missing values per row One way of visualizing the missing patterns by row is by using the mi package. For the purposes of the visualization of this section, we first drop all rows that do not have missing values. Moreover, in order to be able to capture the variable level differences for each column, we have used a log transformation to the numeric columns of the dataframe. We used this transformation instead of Standardization because there are very big differences in values for each column which initally resulted in a single-color graph. ## NOTE: The following pairs of variables appear to have the same missingness pattern. ## Please verify whether they are in fact logically distinct variables. ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] &quot;Adj.Close&quot; &quot;Volume&quot; In the above graph we can see that we have missing values appear on the Adj.Close, Volume, users_holding,vix_Adj_close and Mcap columns as expected. We can start seeing some different patterns. More specifically: ## Mcap ## 4702 ## users_holding ## 14079 ## users_holding, Mcap ## 1094 ## Adj.Close, Volume ## 12 ## Adj.Close, Volume, users_holding, vix_Adj_close ## 800 To summarize the above, we can see standalone missing values for Mcap and users_holding with the highest counts. we can then see a pattern when we are both missing users_holding and Mcap. Another pattern lies in missing Adj.Close and Volume. The last pattern we observe is missing all of the following: Adj.Close, Volume, users_holding,vix_Adj_close 4.3 Frequency of patterns We take another look at our missing patterns. Here, the rows represent a missing pattern and the columns represent the column level missing values.We have sorted the graph by most to least common missing pattern and the most to least common missing row. 4.4 Interpreting the results Pattern 1: Missing users_holding: In our option there is not really intuition on why users_holding is missing. We assume that the Robintrack didn’t report this variable on certain days.(can improve this with plotting if it for days and stocks seeing if there is something there) Pattern 2: Missing Mcap: Similarly for Mcap, we assume it wasn’t reported on certain days for no specific reason.(can improve this with plotting if it for days and stocks seeing if there is something there) Pattern 3: Missing Mcapand users_holding: A combination of the above two explanations. Pattern 4: Missing Adj.Close and Volume: This missing pattern is also a little unusal. We would expect to have values for both Adj.Close and Volume since we have values for the VIX, Market Cap and users holding. Our assumption is that Yahoo Finance didn’t report these values. We confirmed this by comparing those missing dates against another source which had values for those dates. Pattern 5: Missing Adj.Close, Volume, users_holding andvix_Adj_close: This is a more meaningful pattern. Our hypothesis is that those entries are missing at the same time because the company was not part of the S&amp;P500 on those specific dates. Note that a comapny can still report Mcap even if it is not listed in the S&amp;P500. 4.5 Dealing with missing values We decided to remove the rows that contained missing values. "]]
