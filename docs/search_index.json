Robinhood is an investment app focused on retail investors. In particular, retail investors have significantly increased their usage and presence on Robinhood amid the post-COVID market volatility. This spurred heightened focus and attention by news reports and financial institutions to see if there’s any insight we can see from these retail involvement in the stock market. While there are thousands of companies one can invest in on the app, we focus our analysis on the companies in the S&amp;P500 index as of November 2020. The index include 500 of the largest companies listed on the US stock exchanges and is one of the most commonly followed stock indices. Similarly we narrowed our focus to between August 2018 to August 2020 given the availability of data and there’s greater activity on Robinhood during the recent years. In our analysis, we first look across the entire dataset to see if there’s any noteworthy pattern based on company industries. Then we examined investor’s interest in specific companies and further focused on the ones with the most number of Robinhood users holding its stocks. We also looked at the founding year of companies to gauge whether investors preferred old or new companies. Lastly, we put together an interactive feature that invites the reader to view how companies’ popularity ranking changed over the years. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources We used three main sources for the data in this research project. We use the Robintrack website to get the ownership data from Robinhood. This data is pulled from the Robinhood API which provides this data for free to the world. It provides a csv file for each ticker and documents the number of unique accounts holding at least one share of the stock from May 2018 to August 2020. As per the source, the data was collected from the Robinhood API once per hour. We will refer to the number of unique accounts holding at least one share of the stock as “ownership” and is a indicator of a stock’s “popularity” among Robinhood users. This only includes accounts that have normal long shares and do not impact any impacts from options. Note as publicly disclosed on various news articles, Robinhood stopped making this information public in August 2020 so our dataset ends in 8/1/2020. In addition, we scrapped Yahoo Finance to get the stock price and trading volume of each company during the corresponding time period. As we will expand on in the “Missing Data” section, we discovered that Yahoo Finance has some bugs where it does not have information over a certain periods of time for certain companies but these glitches were few and far in-between. Lastly, we pulled the market capitalization of all the companies in the S&amp;P500, daily VIX and companies characteristics from Bloomberg during the relevant time period. Both Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg are credited sources commonly used in the finance industry. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Raw data 3.2 Further preprocessing 3.3 Results dataframes", " Chapter 3 Data transformation In this Chapter we will go over the data transformations that we performed in order to combine the different data sources into one. We performed the data cleaning in four Python notebooks that can be found under the docs/data/preprocessing folder. Here we will provide an overview of what we have done. Please take a look at the notebooks if you need further detail. 3.1 Raw data In this section we will briefly describe how we transformed the raw data 3.1.1 Robintrack data As we mentioned in the Data Sources section, we got the number of users holding each company stock per day from Robintrack. The Robintrack data came in a folder that contained a csv for each company ticker. We read each csv, selected the data for August 2018 - August 2020 and combined them to a dataframe with the following columns: Date, Sybol, users_holding. Code can be found here: data/preprocessing/Robintrack.ipynb. 3.1.2 S&amp;P500 stock prices and volume Furthermore, we got the daily Closing Price and the total Volume traded between August 2018 - August 2020 for each company by scraping yahoo finance. More specifically, for each of the S&amp;P500 tickers, we used the python package pandas_datareader to read those values from yahoo finance for the range of dates that we are interested in. We combined those dataframes and resulting in one large dataframe with the following columns: Date, Sybol, Adj.Close and Volume. Code can be found here: data/preprocessing/sp500.ipynb. 3.1.3 VIX and Mcap We got both Vix and Market cap from Bloomberg Terminal. For Market cap we had to select the tickers we are interested since the raw file contained other companies which are not included in the S&amp;P500 list. The the volatility index was in ready-to-use format since it contained the index value by date. 3.1.4 Company characteristics We got both each companies characteristics from Bloomberg Terminal. Some characteristics that we are particularly interested in are Industry and Year_Founded. 3.1.5 Combination of the above We combined everything together in one dataframe. We performed an outer join on Date and Symbol which resulted in our final dataframe with the following columns: Date, Sybol, users_holding,Adj.Close, Volume, Mcap, vix_Adj_close. We also performed a few sanity checks such as making sure that we are only keeping the trading days between August 2018 - August 2020 and that for each date we have all tickers. Code can be found here: data/preprocessing/combine.ipynb 3.2 Further preprocessing We decided further combine and preprocessing all of the different dataframes in Python. 3.2.1 Clustering 3.2.1.1 Clustering on users_holding We measure a stock’s popularity by averaging amount of user’s holding across 2018-2020. Intuitively a company with a high average stock holding will be a popular company among Robintrack’s users and vise verse. We want to find a way to separate the companies into three popularity groups. One way to do this is to split the data evenly across three sections. However, in our case, a few companies attract users a lot more than others and if we were to follow this approach we would end up with groups that are very uneven in terms of scale. In order to work around this issue,we assign each company to a popularity level by using K Means clustering(k=3) for the average user’s holding over those 3 years. The three popularity categories are; not_popular(n=473), normal(n=16) and very_popular(n=5). Note that this clustering results to uneven clusters as we would expect. Bellow is a visualization of the clusters produced by python. Therefore, we have defined the following popularity ranges: cluster 0: normal(n=16) cluster 1: not_popular(n=473) cluster 2: very_popular(n=5) 3.2.1.2 Clustering on Year_Founded: Following a similar line of thinking, we grouped the companies based on their Founded year. We wanted to avoid uneven groups in terms of founding years therefore we again used K Means clustering(k=3). For each group we recorded the minimum and maximum founding rate and used that as the as group’s label. More specifically the three founding ranges are;1784-1892(n=247),1894-1952(n=400), 1954-2019(n=798). Bellow is a visualization of the clusters produced by python. Founding Clusters Therefore, we have defined the following founded ranges: cluster 0: 1894-1952(n=400) cluster 1: 1784-1892(n=247) cluster 2: 1954-2019(n=798) Code can be found here: data/preprocessing/Results_preprocessing.ipynb. 3.3 Results dataframes Description of the final dataframes that we use in Results section 3.3.1 data.csv -Date: date -Symbol: a companies ticker -users_holding: number of users holding that stock on that date -Adj.Close: adjusted close price -Volume: traded volume -Mcap: market cap -vix_Adj_close: vix; market index -Symbol_industry: the industry of the company -popularity: either of not_popular, normal, very_popular 3.3.2 cleveland.csv -Year: year -Symbol: a company’s ticker -avg_users_holding: average number of users holding that stock on that year 3.3.3 mosaic.csv -Symbol_industry: the company’s industry -founded_range: the founding range as defined in the clustering section -popularity: the popularity level as defined in the clustering section -freq: how many times the above combination of values have appeared in the dataset Files can be found here data/results. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Overview of missing values 4.2 Visualizing missing values per row 4.3 Frequency of patterns 4.4 Interpreting the results 4.5 Dealing with missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values In this section we will explore the missing values in our dataset and offer some hypotheses on why this might be happening. We will also investigate if we have missing patterns and try to understand the cause behind that. 4.1 Overview of missing values First we read in the raw data. We haven’t performed any tranformations to the dataframe apart from combining the different datasources. In order to start exploring missing values we will look at the ratio of the number of NAs in each column: ## Date Symbol Adj.Close Volume users_holding ## 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.003158734 0.003158734 0.062136036 ## vix_Adj_close Mcap ## 0.003112053 0.022546827 We can see immediately that we have a very low percentage in missing values. The columns in our dataframe that have the most missing entries are Mcap and users_holding with around 2% and 6% missing values respectively. 4.2 Visualizing missing values per row One way of visualizing the missing patterns by row is by using the mi package. For the purposes of the visualization of this section, we first drop all rows that do not have missing values. Since we have almost 21k missing values we randomly subsampled the missing values dataframe to create a smaller one. In order to get a first idea of the shape of the missing values we can take a look at the following graph: ## NOTE: The following pairs of variables appear to have the same missingness pattern. ## Please verify whether they are in fact logically distinct variables. ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] &quot;Adj.Close&quot; &quot;Volume&quot; ## [2,] &quot;Adj.Close&quot; &quot;vix_Adj_close&quot; ## [3,] &quot;Volume&quot; &quot;vix_Adj_close&quot; We can see that most missing values appear on the users_holding and Mcap columns and a combination of the two. Another block of missing values is formed with the following collums Adj.Close,Volume,vix_Adj_close and users_holding. We realize that since this is a random sub-sample of the dataframe and that there might be more missing patterns. Nevertheless, the above graph captures the strongest missing-value trends. Taking a closer look on those patterns: ## NOTE: The following pairs of variables appear to have the same missingness pattern. ## Please verify whether they are in fact logically distinct variables. ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] &quot;Adj.Close&quot; &quot;Volume&quot; ## Mcap ## 4702 ## users_holding ## 14079 ## users_holding, Mcap ## 1094 ## Adj.Close, Volume ## 12 ## Adj.Close, Volume, users_holding, vix_Adj_close ## 800 To summarize the above: We can see standalone missing values for users_holding and Mcap with the highest counts. There is a pattern when both users_holding and Mcap are missing. Another pattern lies in missing Adj.Close and Volume. The last pattern we observe is missing all of the following: Adj.Close, Volume, users_holding,vix_Adj_close. 4.3 Frequency of patterns We take another look at our missing patterns. Here, the rows represent a pattern and the columns represent the column level missing values. We have sorted the graph by most to least common missing pattern and the most to least common missing row. 4.4 Interpreting the results Pattern 1: Missing users_holding: In our opinion there is not really intuition on why users_holding is missing. We assume that the Robintrack didn’t report this variable on certain days.We assume that this value is missing completely at Random. Pattern 2: Missing Mcap: Similarly for Mcap. We assume that it is missing completely at Random. Pattern 3: Missing Mcapand users_holding: A combination of the above two explanations. Pattern 4: Missing Adj.Close, Volume, users_holding andvix_Adj_close: This is a more meaningful pattern. Our hypothesis is that those entries are missing at the same time because the company was not part of the S&amp;P500 on those specific dates. Note we still have Mcap data because that is pulled from Bloomberg versus Yahoo Finance. Bloomberg can recognize a name change of ticker whereas Yahoo does not. Pattern 5: Missing Adj.Close and Volume: Our assumption is that Yahoo Finance didn’t report these values. We have values for the VIX, Market Cap and users holding therefore we should also have values for Adj.Close and Volume. We confirmed our assumption by comparing those missing dates against another source which had the correct values for those dates. 4.5 Dealing with missing values We decided to remove the rows that contained missing values. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Important terms 5.2 Yearly average stock ownership by industry 5.3 A closer look at the companies 5.4 Ownership of the very_popular companies 5.5 Ownership vs Founding Year", " Chapter 5 Results The main focus of our analysis will examine Robihood’s users stock holding of the S&amp;P500 companies between August 2018 - August 2020. We will explore how price, market cap, industry and founding year affect user’s holding. 5.1 Important terms We quantify how popular a company is by how many Robihood users hold its stock. More specifically, as mentioned in the data transformation section, we measure a stock’s popularity by averaging the amount of users holding across 2018-2020. Moreover, we assign each company to a popularity group by using KMeans clustering(k=3) for the average user’s holding over those 3 years. The three popularity categories are; not_popular(n=473), normal(n=16) and very_popular(n=5). As expected, most of the companies in the S&amp;P500 belong in the not_popular category and only 5 companies in the very_popular category. 5.2 Yearly average stock ownership by industry First we explore the average user’s stock holding per industry for 2018, 2019 and 2020. In order explore the shifts in the most popular industries between 2018-2020, we have created a Cleveland plot for which we have sorted the y axis in descending order for the users holding on 2020. Some insights that we can extract from the above plot are: We can see a jump in users holding for across all industries between 2018/2019 and 2020. A possible explanation is that retail trading has taken off in 2020 amid the coronavirus downturn that many young traders saw as an entry point into the world of investing. This jump is especially evident in the following industries;Comunication Services, Consumer Discretionary,Industrials and Energy. The largest jump in user’s holding between 2019 and 2020 was in the Consumer Discretionary industry. A possible explanation could be the increased interest of the Amazon (AMZN) stock during the pandemic. Even though Information Technology industry had the second highest average user’s holding in 2018 and 2019, in 2020 it dropped to 4th place. Similarly in 2018 &amp; 2019 Energy industry was less attractive than Consumer Staples. However, in 2020 Energy attracted more stock holders. Moreover, Consumer Staples and Industrials industries have almost the same stock holding between 2018 and 2019. That trend was broken in 2020 when Industrials almost tripled in user’s holding compared to Consumer Staples. Another trend that we observe is that Utilities, Materials and Real Estate have similar average user’s holding between 2018 and 2019. On the other hand the rest of the industries have experienced an increase in user’s holding between these two years. 5.3 A closer look at the companies After exploring the trends in users holding by industry, we dig deeper to see if there are any patterns at the individual company level. As we already mentioned in the introduction of this section we divide the companies into three categories: very popular, normally popular. In the subsequent data exploration, we focus our attention on the “very popular” category given there are much greater investor attention on these companies. We first take a look at companies within the most popular category. ## [1] &quot;F&quot; &quot;GE&quot; &quot;AAPL&quot; &quot;MSFT&quot; &quot;DIS&quot; The top five most popular (by average number of account owners) companies are F (Ford Motors Vehicle), GE (General Electric Company), AAPL (Apple), MSFT (Microsoft), and DIS (Disney). Unsurprisingly these are well-established companies that most households know. This is consistent with intuition that the most investors using the Robinhood app are retail investors so would invest in stable, well-known companies. ## [1] &quot;AMD&quot; &quot;FB&quot; &quot;BAC&quot; &quot;AMZN&quot; &quot;TWTR&quot; &quot;NFLX&quot; &quot;AAL&quot; &quot;DAL&quot; &quot;NVDA&quot; &quot;SBUX&quot; ## [11] &quot;T&quot; &quot;CCL&quot; &quot;BA&quot; &quot;KO&quot; &quot;MU&quot; &quot;NCLH&quot; In the second tier of “normal”(ly) popular companies are AMD (Advanced Micro Devices), FB (Facebook), BAC (Bank of America), AMZN (Amazon), TWTR (Twitter), NFLX (Netflix), AAL (American Airline), DAL (Delta Airline), DAL (Nvidia), SBUX (Starbucks), T (AT&amp;T), Carnival, Boeing, Coca-Cola, Micron Technology, and Norwegian Cruise Line. Most of these companies are also well-established companies, these are additional intuition supporting relatively higher account ownership behind these stocks. Many of these companies were heavily impacted by the pandemic and received intense investor attention in the post-COVID financial market. Travel-related companies such as American Airline, Delta Airline, and Boeing as well as leisure-related companies including Carnival and Norwegian Cruise line had businesses that were negatively impacted by the restriction imposed during the pandemic. This led to their stock prices to plummet considerably. Retail investors perhaps saw this as an opportunity to “buy the dip” and increase account ownership for these companies. Another trend we see is the prevalence of tech companies that are positively impacted by the work-from-home dynamic in the post-COVID world. Companies such as Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia produce computing chips and systems for mobile computing. As we shall see later in our data exploration, Robinhood saw a significant increase in new accounts and investing activity post March 2020, further supporting the intuition that companies that were heavily impacted by the pandemic would see heightened attention. 5.4 Ownership of the very_popular companies To better understand the distribution shape of the individual account ownership, we first looked at the histogram of the top 5 companies’ ownership distribution. Looking at the individual account ownership of the top 5 most popular companies, we can see that they are all right skewed distribution. There is one peak with high frequency for &lt;= 250k account owners. For companies like Disney, Ford, and General Electric there is a second peak near the highest number of accounts (750k-1mm) but that peak is much smaller the first at the lower end. This makes intuitive sense as the second peak of high number of accounts would result in an elevated average account ownership putting in on the most popular list. The more popular companies (such as F and GE) tend to have wider min-to-max ranges than the less popular ones. Next, we use boxplots to show the distribution of account ownership of the individual stocks within the most popular category. The circle denotes the mean for comparison with the quartiles. Looking at the boxplots: It is evident that there are considerably number of outliers across all 5 companies. Almost all of the outliers are skewed toward the high end which would increase the average account ownership across the time period. General Electric and Ford are the most popular among the top 5 companies. However, General Electric has a smaller spread than Ford. With the exception of Microsoft, the mean across the remaining 4 companies seems to be near or above the upper hinge. Apple stands out with a much smaller H-spread compared to the other companies suggesting that the number of accounts who owned Apple is concentrated around just below the 250k mark. Within the H-spread, the length to the lower hinge and upper hinge look to be relatively symmetric. Next we used time series line graphs of price, Market Cap and VIX to introduce time as a new perspective to users holding. By looking at the daily number of account owners for a particular stock changed over time, we can easily see a significant increase around the March-April 2020 time frame. Visually we can see that all of the outliers at significantly large number of account owners are during the later end of the available dataset near summer 2020. This is consistent with what we observed in the boxplot and histogram where for the majority of time period (from Aug 2018 to March 2020), the daily number of account owners was relatively stable within a tight range. Next, we plot the stock prices of the top 5 most popular companies to see if there’s any relationship between the stock price and number of account owners. We look at both the actual stock value and the normalized stock price. Some observations from the above plot: There is a major drop in stock prices for all very_popular companies in March 2020. These prices dropped almost two weeks after the first COVID case in the US. Prices recovered from their drop during end of March 2020 and began rising. This increasing trend is in sync with the increasing number of Robinhood users holding these stocks. Price is negatively correlated with the popularity of a stock. For example, Ford and General Electric have the lowest stock prices among the very_popularand they have the highest user’s holding. This aligns with our intuition that the low price makes these two stocks an attractive investment for Robinhood’s users. On the other hand, Microsoft in August 2020 was the most expensive stock to buy and had the lowest amount of users holding it. All very_popular companie’s stock price was dropping during March 2020. After March 2020 stock prices increased. For Microsoft and Apple, stock prices rose so sharply until August 2020 that they were almost double of what they were in August 2018. This rise in price also follows the trend of the increase in numbers of users investing in these companies. Interestingly enough, even though Disney in August 2020 had more user’s holding it’s stock than Apple and Microsoft, it didn’t pick up the sharp increase in price. August 2020 and August 2018 prices are not that different. From August 2018 to November 2020, Disney’s and Microsoft’s stock price was following similar patterns. However, from November 2020 onward, Microsoft had an increase in price and Disney a drop in price. In August 2020 Microsoft’s stock price was almost twice as much as Disney’s. Disney at the end of April 2019 annouced plans to launch its own streaming video platform. We can therefore see users increased interst in Disney stock through an increase both in popularity and price. This trend ended due to the pandemic. In order to be able to better compare the stock prices among those companies, we standardized all prices to be 100 in August 2018. Our goal is to see their relative increases and decreases till August 2020. This plot makes it is easier to compare how these companies stock price changed through August 2018 - August 2020. General Electric had some price drops during November 2018- February 2019 as well as August 2019 and October 2019. It recovered from those price drops until COVID. It didn’t recover the stock price compared to the other very_popular companies. Ford’s price was steady throughout 2018-2019 until March 2019. After than price drop, it didn’t manage to recover fully. Apple’s stock price wasn’t as high as Disney’s and Microsoft’s from December 2018 to October 2019. However, it steadily rose since June 2019 and surpassed Disney’s price in October 2019. It is evident from this graph that both Apple and Microsoft have exhibited similar increasing price patterns during August 2018 - August 2020. We also looked at the market capitalization of these 5 companies. The market capitalization measures the size of the company’s outstanding equity value. It is calculated by stock price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. Since stock price level is an input in the market capitalization, it is unsurprising that the daily market cap of the companies follow a similar shape to the stock price. In this graph, Apple has a higher market cap than Microsoft despite Microsoft having a higher stock price. This trend is not statistically meaningful because Microsoft simply has lower number of shares outstanding. From the graphs, we can see that across all 5 companies, the stock price took a hit in March 2020 coinciding with the onset of the pandemic in the US. After the initial drop in price, the stock prices slowly increased back up. It is not consistent whether the stock prices increased back to the pre-pandemic level. One theory for this behavior is that investors using Robinhood took the opportunity to buy stocks when the price was low. Since these 5 companies are well established companies that are unlikely to be negatively impacted by the pandemic, investors increased their ownership of these stocks. They continued to buy these stocks as the stock prices continue to rise as a positive feedback loop to the positive returns on their investments. Lastly, we looked at the VIX index which measure the market-implied pricing for markets volatility. It is an industry standard metric that indicates investor’s expectation for uncertainty with a higher number corresponding to higher volatility. We see that the VIX spiked significantly during the March-April 2020 time frame corresponding to when we saw a drop in stock price. Since the VIX is an indicator across the broader S&amp;P500 index, it suggests that the outsized stock price movement was not limited to just the top 5 companies that we looked at. It further validates our original intuition that there is a trend of Robinhood investors taking advantage of the market uncertainty in March/April 2020 to buy certain well-established companies. By buying in well known companies with limited adverse impact from COVID-19, the investors can invest their money in a relatively safe stock that preserve capital and buy at a lower price with the hope that the stock returns back to previous levels. The continuation of higher account owners may be both attributed to higher overall accounts on Robinhood as well as positive feedback from subsequent stock performance. 5.5 Ownership vs Founding Year As mentioned in the transformation section, we have also split the companies in three founding dates ranges. We again used KMeans clustering(k=3) in order to group the S&amp;P500 companies in three age groups for which we recorded the minimum and maximum founding rate in each group as their label. More specifically the three founding ranges are;1784-1892(n=247),1894-1952(n=400), 1954-2019(n=798). Key takeaways from the above plot: When comparing the old and the medium founding range companies (1784-1892and 1894-1952) there seems to be a positive correlation with popularity. Companies that were founded in 1894-1952 are more likely to belong to the normal and the very_popular categories compared to companies founded in 1784-1892. However, this positive correlation trend is broken when we look at the most recently founded companies. This group has the most normal popularity companies across all founding range groups. Companies that were most recently founded have the least count in the very_popular category. We would have been able to identify a positive correlation between how recently a company was founded and how popular the company is among Robinhood users. However this trend is broken in the 1954-2019 companies. Most of the companies are in the not_popular category. It seems that for this category it doesn’t really matter when the company was founded. A possible explanation of the partial positive correlation between founding year and popularity could due to the fact that older companies have been around for longer and thus people know of them. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component We created an interactive bar graph that displays the yearly average ownership of the top 21 most popular stocks between August 2018 - August 2020. The top 21 stocks are the previously noted stocks in the very_popular and normal categories. You can select the year to display the corresponding yearly average ownership of that year. While the graph originally displays the top 21 most popular stocks in order of descending popularity over the entire time horizon, you can toggle a “Sort Companies” check box that will sort the companies in order of popularity of that specific year. This allows the reader to see how the number of users holding the stocks (ie metric for popularity) changed over time. This graph also invites the readers to see how the ranking changed over time. Specifically it gives the reader an ability to compare a stock’s popularity in a given year relatively to the popularity over the entire time horizon. For example, we can see stocks in the COVID-sensitive industries such as AAL (American Airline) had little interest from Robinhood investors in 2019. But in 2020, the number of users holding the stock spiked moving its ranking to much higher in 2020 and overall in the two year horizon. Follow NCLH (Norwegian Cruise Line) through each year to see how its popularity ranking change over time. We use the link http://plnkr.co/edit/BMjxu8bzhu9WR9gtZwDS?p=preview&amp;preview as reference template to help build our graph. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion In conclusion, we examined Robinhood user data to see how have investment preference for retail investors change over time on the platform. Using the number of accounts who owned the stock as a proxy for popularity, we explored the data looking at individual companies and company characteristics. Further areas of exploration can include looking at stocks outside of the S&amp;P500 index and over different time periods. Anecdoctally, news articles have mentioned companies such as Tesla that were out of scope for this analysis, as potentially popular stocks with Robinhood users with noteworthy pattern. Unfortunately this Robinhood data was ceased to be available to the public in August 2020 as it would be interesting to apply our methodology over data from the last few months to observe more recent trends. Given the number of accounts on the entire Robinhood platform continued to increase since August 2020, having access to more recent data would provide more data points and leave room for future analysis.
